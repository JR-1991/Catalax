Catalax is a computational framework that bridges mechanistic biochemical modeling with modern machine learning. Built on JAX for lightning-fast performance, Catalax enables researchers to tackle the most challenging problems in biochemical modelling and systems biology, from parameter estimation in complex reaction networks to discovering unknown biochemical mechanisms directly from experimental data.

Whether you're modeling enzyme kinetics, discovering metabolic pathways, or quantifying parameter uncertainty through Bayesian inference, Catalax provides the tools and mathematical rigor needed for reproducible, publication-quality research.

## Installation

Catalax is available on PyPI and can be installed with:

```bash
pip install catalax
```

## Quick Start: From Reaction to Simulation

Get started with Catalax in just a few lines of code. Here's how to build and simulate a complete enzyme kinetics model:

```python
import catalax as ctx
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Create and define the biochemical system
model = ctx.Model(name="Michaelis-Menten Kinetics")

# Add states and their dynamics
model.add_state(S="Substrate", E="Enzyme", ES="Complex", P="Product")
model.add_ode("S", "-k1*E*S + k2*ES")
model.add_ode("E", "-k1*E*S + k2*ES + kcat*ES") 
model.add_ode("ES", "k1*E*S - k2*ES - kcat*ES")
model.add_ode("P", "kcat*ES")

# Set kinetic parameters
model.parameters.k1.value = 0.1    # Association rate
model.parameters.k2.value = 0.05   # Dissociation rate  
model.parameters.kcat.value = 0.02 # Catalytic rate

# Create experimental conditions and simulate
dataset = ctx.Dataset.from_model(model)
dataset.add_initial(S=100, E=10, ES=0, P=0)  # Initial concentrations

config = ctx.SimulationConfig(t0=0, t1=100, nsteps=1000)
results = model.simulate(dataset=dataset, config=config)

# Visualize the simulation
results.plot()
```

**That's it!** You've just created a complete biochemical model, simulated its dynamics, and generated publication-ready visualizations. Now let's explore what makes Catalax powerful for advanced research.
